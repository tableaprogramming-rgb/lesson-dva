A logo is a functional tool first, an artwork second.

**Concepts Covered:**
- **The S.M.A.R.T Logo:** Simple, Memorable, Appropriate, Resizable, and Timeless.

### 2. Beyond the Mark: Brand Identity
A logo alone cannot carry a brand.

**Concepts Covered:**
- **Color Systems:** Primary, secondary, and accent colors that define a brand's emotional frequency.

### 3. The Designer’s Workflow
Professional branding follows a path from research to delivery.

**Concepts Covered:**

### 4. Performance Tasks
1. **Logo Challenge:** Create a vector logo based on a specific business brief (e.g., a high-tech startup vs. an organic bakery).
2. **The Brand Style Guide:** A multi-page document outlining how the brand should—and shouldn't—be used.
