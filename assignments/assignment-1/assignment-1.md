# Role: Senior Digital Design Consultant
# Task: Visual Audit and Redesign Strategy

## Project Context
I am currently studying **Digital Visual Design**. I have a screenshot from Google Street View of a real-world design (signage/billboard/storefront) that is visually ineffective. I need to perform "Digital Surgery" to fix it.

## Part 1: Diagnostic Analysis
Analyze the provided design based on the following "Bad Design" criteria:
* **Typographic Hierarchy:** Identify if the focal point is missing or if elements are competing for attention.
* **Contrast & Legibility:** Evaluate the color choices and text readability from a distance.
* **Visual Noise:** Note any unnecessary clutter, images, or "vibrating" colors.
* **Technical Errors:** Look for poor kerning (letter spacing), leading (line spacing), or alignment issues.

## Part 2: Improvement Strategy (The Redesign)
Provide a step-by-step technical plan to improve the design using professional tools (Photoshop/Illustrator):
1.  **Hierarchy:** Explain how to use scale and weight to create a clear focal point.
2.  **Typography:** Suggest specific font styles (e.g., Sans-Serif) for better street-level readability.
3.  **Color Theory:** Recommend a high-contrast color palette (e.g., 60-30-10 rule).
4.  **Composition:** Explain how to use a Grid System and Negative Space to reduce clutter.

## Output Format
Please provide the response in two clear sections: 
1. **The Diagnosis** (Identifying the "Bad" elements).
2. **The Digital Surgery** (Step-by-step technical improvements).
