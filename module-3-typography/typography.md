# Module 3: Typography — Digital Visual Arts (DVA)

## 📖 Complete Study Guide & Transcript

### Overview
Typography is where **design meets language**. This module shifts from working with visual shapes and images to working with letterforms—the most precise, powerful, and nuanced tool in a designer's arsenal. Typography is not simply choosing a font. It's a comprehensive system that includes font selection, spacing, alignment, sizing, weight, color, and hierarchy.

In Modules 1-2, you learned the visual foundation. In Module 3, you zoom in on the details that make communication resonant, memorable, and professional.

## 1. What is Typography?

### Beyond Font Choice
Many beginners think typography = picking a font. Not true. Typography is the **entire discipline of making text communicate effectively**. It includes:

- **Font Selection:** Which typeface matches the message?
- **Sizing:** What point size supports readability?
- **Spacing:** How should letters, words, and lines relate to each other?
- **Color & Contrast:** Does the text stand out? Is it legible?
- **Alignment & Flow:** How do readers navigate the text?
- **Hierarchy:** What's most important?

### Three Responsibilities of Typography

**1. Legibility**
Can the reader *see and distinguish individual letters*? This is determined by:
- Typeface design (serifs, stroke weight, x-height)
- Font size relative to viewing distance
- Color contrast against the background
- Whether tricky letter pairs are distinguishable (l vs. I, O vs. 0, 1 vs. I)

**2. Readability**
Can the reader *understand and process text comfortably*? This is determined by:
- Line length (too wide = hard to follow)
- Line spacing / leading (too tight = cramped, too loose = disconnected)
- Paragraph spacing
- Font choice (serifs for long text, sans-serif for web, display fonts for headlines only)
- Alignment and white space

**3. Expression**
Does the typography *convey the right tone and emotion*? This is determined by:
- Font personality (elegant, bold, playful, serious, technical)
- Weight (bold feels strong, light feels refined)
- Color and contrast choices
- Creative use of scale and hierarchy

## 2. A Brief History of Type

Understanding where fonts come from helps you understand what they're designed for.

### Key Eras

**Gutenberg (1440s)**
- Johannes Gutenberg invents movable type and the printing press
- Early typefaces mimicked handwriting
- Serifs appeared as a side effect of metal casting—they helped the typeface sit properly on the metal slug
- Serif fonts born from necessity

**Industrial Era (1800s)**
- Factories need bold, heavy fonts for signage and posters
- Sans-serif fonts emerge (first called "grotesques")
- High contrast fonts designed for legibility from afar

**Digital Age (1980s-2000s)**
- Computers change everything
- Screen resolution matters—thin serifs can look jagged on pixels
- Web-safe fonts emerge (Arial, Georgia, Verdana)
- Digital typefaces designed specifically for screen rendering

**Modern Web (2010+)**
- Custom web fonts become standard (@font-face in CSS)
- Variable fonts allow smooth weight variations
- Responsive typography (sizing changes with device)
- Performance optimization (font file sizes matter)

### Why History Matters
A typeface created in 1450 for metal casting behaves completely differently than one designed in 2020 for mobile screens. Understanding a font's origin tells you what it's optimized for.

---

## 3. Typeface Classifications

### Serif Typefaces
**What they are:** Fonts with small lines (serifs) extending from the ends of letterstrokes.

**History:** Originally a byproduct of metal type casting. Serifs helped the letter sit on the metal slug. When printing to paper, serifs had the pleasant side effect of guiding the eye horizontally across lines of text.

**Psychology:**
- Convey tradition, authority, elegance
- Associated with institutions (newspapers, law, academia)
- Feel "established" and "reliable"

**Common Serif Fonts:**
- **Georgia:** Elegant, classic, designed for screen readability
- **Garamond:** High-end, refined, fashion magazines
- **Times New Roman:** Formal, newspaper-like, official documents
- **Bodoni:** Luxury, high fashion, premium branding
- **Cambria:** Modern serif, designed for screen, professional documents

**Best Uses:**
- Long-form reading (books, novels, academic papers)
- Professional documents (resumes, business letters)
- Traditional institutions (law firms, banks, heritage brands)
- Print design (magazines, newspapers)

---

### Sans-Serif Typefaces
**What they are:** Fonts with no serifs—clean, minimalist letterforms.

**History:** Designed in the Industrial Era for bold, large-scale signage. Originally called "grotesques" because traditional designers thought they were ugly. Now the most common category.

**Psychology:**
- Convey modernity, clarity, approachability
- Feel contemporary and friendly
- Associated with technology and innovation

**Common Sans-Serif Fonts:**
- **Helvetica / Arial:** Neutral, reliable, ubiquitous (overused)
- **Futura:** Geometric, bold, retro-futuristic (1920s design)
- **Gotham:** Friendly, modern, media/tech companies
- **Montserrat:** Geometric, geometric, web-friendly
- **Open Sans / Lato:** Clean, versatile, web standards

**Best Uses:**
- Web and digital design (screens render sans-serif better)
- Contemporary branding (tech, startups, lifestyle)
- UI/UX (user interfaces, apps)
- Headlines and posters
- Technical documentation

---

### Display & Decorative Fonts
**What they are:** Bold, expressive, personality-driven typefaces designed for headlines and short text.

**Psychology:**
- Grab attention
- Convey mood or personality
- Command presence on the page

**Common Display Fonts:**
- **Impact:** Bold, heavy, confident (used everywhere, now cliché)
- **Playfair Display:** Elegant, high-fashion, luxury
- **Bebas Neue:** Bold, geometric, contemporary headlines
- **Fredoka:** Rounded, friendly, youthful
- **Poppins:** Round, modern, approachable

**Critical Rule:**
Display fonts are for headlines, titles, and short bursts of text ONLY. Never use for body copy. Never use for long paragraphs. They're designed for impact, not comfort.

---

### Script & Handwritten Fonts
**What they are:** Fonts that mimic handwriting or calligraphy.

**Psychology:**
- Convey elegance, intimacy, personality
- Suggest handcraft and care
- Can feel personal or emotional

**Common Script Fonts:**
- **Pacifico:** Casual, friendly handwriting
- **Dancing Script:** Elegant, flowing, special occasions
- **Great Vibes:** Formal, calligraphy-inspired, invitations
- **Brush Script:** Loose, expressive, artistic

**Critical Rule:**
Use sparingly. Very sparingly. A sentence in script? Elegant. A paragraph? Exhausting. Never use script for body copy.

---

### Monospace Fonts
**What they are:** Every letter takes up the same width. Designed for code and technical documentation.

**Common Monospace Fonts:**
- **Courier New:** Classic, typewriter feel
- **Fira Code:** Modern, programming, liabilities
- **Source Code Pro:** Professional, technical
- **Roboto Mono:** Contemporary, flexible

**Best Uses:**
- Code blocks
- Technical documentation
- Creating a "technical" or "computer" feel
- Poetry (sometimes, for visual effect)

---

## 4. Understanding Type Anatomy

Before using fonts, you need to see them clearly. Type anatomy is the vocabulary of letterforms.

### Key Measurements

**Baseline**
The imaginary line that letters sit on. Descenders drop below it.

**Cap Height**
The height of uppercase letters (like "H" or "M"). Not the same as x-height.

**X-Height**
The height of lowercase letters without ascenders or descenders (like "x", "a", "e"). Crucial for readability. Larger x-height = easier to read at small sizes.

**Ascender**
The part of letters like "b," "d," "k," "l" that rises above the x-height.

**Descender**
The part of letters like "g," "p," "q," "y," "j" that drops below the baseline.

**Stroke**
The main vertical or diagonal line of a letter (the "body" of the letter).

**Counter**
The enclosed space inside a letter (the "hole" in "o", "a", "P").

**Serif**
The small line extending from the end of a stroke.

### Why It Matters
- Large x-height = readable at small sizes (good for body text)
- Small x-height = elegant but harder to read small (use for headlines only)
- Long ascenders/descenders = need more line spacing
- Open counters = easier to read (important for dyslexic readers)
- Understanding anatomy = choosing fonts that actually work for your purpose

## 5. The Three Spacings: Kerning, Tracking & Leading

These three concepts are foundational to professional typography.

### Kerning
**Definition:** The spacing between specific letter pairs.

**Example:** The letters "A" and "V" naturally have too much space between them. Their diagonal shapes create a gap. Kerning tightens this relationship.

**Why It Matters:**
- Professional kerning is the difference between amateur and polished
- Automatic kerning (what design software does by default) is rarely perfect
- Headlines especially need manual kerning adjustment

**How to Kern:**
- Look for problematic pairs: AV, AT, Ty, We, etc.
- Adjust manually in your design software
- Trust your eye—if it looks too close, it's probably right
- Professional fonts come with kerning pairs built in (called "kerning tables")

**In Practice:**
"WAVE" with poor kerning looks awkward. With good kerning, it reads naturally.

### Tracking
**Definition:** The overall letter spacing across an entire word or block of text.

**Tight Tracking:** Letters squeezed together. Feels formal, compact, dense.
**Loose Tracking:** Letters spread out. Feels airy, modern, dramatic.

**Why It Matters:**
- Affects the overall "color" of the text
- Tight tracking for formal documents or elegant designs
- Loose tracking for contemporary or playful designs
- ALL CAPS text benefits from increased tracking (all-caps feels cramped otherwise)

**In Practice:**
Headlines in ALL CAPS usually need +50 to +100 tracking to feel comfortable.

### Leading (Pronounced "LED-ing")
**Definition:** Vertical spacing between lines of text (same as CSS "line-height").

**Why the odd name?** In letterpress printing, typographers inserted strips of lead between lines to add space.

**Standard Guidelines:**
- For body text: 120-150% of font size (if text is 12px, use 1.5 line-height = 18px)
- For headlines: 100-120% of font size (headlines are bolder, need less space)
- For web: Increase leading slightly (1.5-1.8) compared to print

**Too Tight:** Text feels cramped, hard to follow line to line.
**Too Loose:** Lines feel disconnected, like separate statements.

**In Practice:**
Leading is one of the most overlooked aspects of typography, but it makes a massive difference in readability and feel.

---

## 6. Legibility vs. Readability (They're Different!)

### Legibility
**Question:** Can the reader *see and distinguish individual letters*?

**Factors:**
- Typeface design (how well-designed are the letter shapes?)
- Font size (is it large enough?)
- Contrast (can you see the letters against the background?)
- Distinguishability of confusing pairs (is lowercase "l" different from uppercase "I"?)

**Example:** A beautiful script font might be highly legible in a 72pt headline, but illegible in 8pt body text.

### Readability
**Question:** Can the reader *understand and process the text comfortably*?

**Factors:**
- Line length (is it too wide? Hard to track where the next line begins)
- Line spacing / leading (is there enough space between lines?)
- Font choice (serif for long text, sans for web)
- Paragraph structure (breaks, indentation)
- Color (is there sufficient contrast for extended reading?)
- Alignment (ragged right is easiest to read, justified can have awkward gaps)

**Example:** A tiny, high-contrast font might be legible (you can see it), but a paragraph of it would be unreadable (exhausting to process).

### The Relationship
- **Both matter:** A beautiful, legible font won't work for body copy if leading is too tight. A readable layout won't work if the font is too small.
- **Different purposes:** Headlines prioritize legibility (stand out!). Body text prioritizes readability (comfort).
- **Context-dependent:** What's legible at 18pt might not be at 9pt. What's readable on a 27" monitor might not be on a phone.

## 7. Font Weight & Width Variations

Professional fonts come with multiple weights. Use them strategically.

### Font Weights

Weights are numbered (100-900) or named:

**Light (300)**
- Elegant, refined, delicate
- Use for: Secondary text, body copy in premium designs, supporting information
- Avoid: Small sizes, low-contrast backgrounds

**Regular / Normal (400)**
- Standard, default weight
- Use for: Body text, standard paragraphs
- The baseline for all typography

**Medium (500)**
- Slightly bolder than regular
- Use for: Subheadings, emphasis within body text
- Often overlooked but useful

**Bold (700)**
- Emphasis, strength, confidence
- Use for: Headlines, important information, bold sentences within text
- Most common secondary weight

**Extra-Bold / Black (900)**
- Maximum impact, attention-grabbing
- Use for: Large headlines, dramatic effects, short statements
- Can be overwhelming in large amounts

### Font Widths

Width variations (not all fonts have them, but many modern typefaces do):

**Condensed**
- Narrow, space-saving, modern
- Use for: Limited space, contemporary designs, small screens
- Creates a sense of urgency or tightness

**Regular**
- Standard proportions
- The baseline for width

**Extended / Wide**
- Spacious, dramatic, bold
- Use for: Posters, headlines, making a statement
- Can feel elegant or theatrical

### Pro Strategy
Don't use multiple fonts. Use multiple weights of the same font. This creates sophistication and cohesion. Example: Use Montserrat Light for body, Montserrat Bold for headings. This looks more professional than mixing Montserrat + Georgia.

---

## 8. Building Typographic Hierarchy

Hierarchy guides the reader's eye. It says "read this first, then this, then this."

### Hierarchy Tools

Use these techniques to create visual levels:

**Size**
- Larger = more important
- Most effective tool
- Headlines should be 2-3x larger than body text

**Weight**
- Bolder = more emphasis
- Bold text stands out
- Pair with size (bold + large = maximum emphasis)

**Color**
- Contrasting color draws attention
- Can highlight key information
- Ensure contrast ratio meets accessibility standards (4.5:1 for body text)

**Position**
- Top-left = first thing read (in left-to-right languages)
- Center = formal emphasis
- White space isolation = importance

**White Space**
- Isolated text feels important
- Surrounded by space = emphasis
- Density suggests relationship (grouped items belong together)

### Creating Visual Levels

Design for 3-4 distinct levels:

**Primary (Headlines)**
- Largest size (48-72pt+)
- Bold weight
- Often a contrasting color
- Purpose: Grab attention, convey main message

**Secondary (Subheadings)**
- Medium size (24-36pt)
- Bold or medium weight
- Purpose: Break content into sections, guide navigation

**Tertiary (Body Text)**
- Standard size (12-16pt depending on medium)
- Regular weight
- Purpose: Convey detailed information

**Quaternary (Fine Print)**
- Small size (8-10pt)
- Light weight
- Lower contrast
- Purpose: Disclaimers, footnotes, legal text

### In Practice
A poster might use just 2 levels (headline + minimal text). A document might use all 4. A homepage might use all 4+ (with additional micro-hierarchy through color and positioning).

## 9. Text Alignment & White Space

How text is aligned creates rhythm and guides reading.

### Alignment Types

**Left-Aligned (Ragged Right)**
- Most natural, easiest to read
- Reader's eye flows naturally left to right
- Default for body text
- "Ragged right" edge creates visual interest

**Right-Aligned (Ragged Left)**
- Formal, design-forward
- Challenging to read (breaks natural eye movement)
- Used sparingly: sidebars, callouts, artistic effects
- Often less readable for body text

**Center-Aligned**
- Formal, ceremonial
- Works for short text (headlines, invitations)
- Difficult for long text (hard to track where next line begins)
- Creates symmetrical, balanced feeling

**Justified**
- Newspaper-like, formal
- Text stretches to fill both margins
- Can create awkward word gaps ("rivers" of white space)
- Requires hyphenation to work well
- Less common in web (CSS text-align: justify generally looks bad)

### White Space Strategy

White space around and between text is as important as the text itself.

**Benefits:**
- Creates breathing room
- Defines hierarchy (grouped elements belong together)
- Improves readability (less visual noise)
- Signals sophistication and care

**In Practice:**
- Paragraph spacing should be larger than line spacing
- Margins should frame the text, not squeeze it
- White space > colored background for most designs
- Generous white space = premium, sophisticated feel
- Cramped spacing = chaotic, amateur feel

---

## 10. Font Pairing & Contrast

Combining fonts effectively is an art.

### Pairing Principles

**Serif + Sans-Serif (Classic Contrast)**
- Traditional headline + Modern body = balanced, professional
- Example: Playfair Display (serif headline) + Open Sans (sans-serif body)
- Works because they're opposite (different eras, personalities)

**Contrast Weights**
- Bold headline + Light body = elegant, clear hierarchy
- Example: Montserrat Bold headline + Montserrat Light body
- Same font family, different weights = cohesion + hierarchy

**Geometric Harmony**
- Fonts from the same era pair well
- Fonts with similar proportions work together
- Example: Futura (geometric, 1920s) + Bodoni (transitional, 1700s) = clash. Futura + Gotham (both geometric, modern) = harmony

**Personality Pairing**
- Fonts should have complementary personalities
- Elegant headline + Elegant body = sophisticated
- Playful headline + Playful body = fun
- Elegant headline + Playful body = contradiction (confusing)

### Pairing Mistakes

**Too Similar**
- Two sans-serifs that look almost the same = confusing
- Readers can't tell if they're different weights or different fonts
- Use contrast (serif + sans, or weights of the same font)

**Too Many Fonts**
- More than 3 fonts = chaotic
- Stick to 2-3 maximum (2 is usually best)

**Conflicting Personalities**
- High-fashion serif + Casual handwriting = contradiction
- Formal document + Playful display font = undermines message

**Ignoring Actual Differences**
- Choosing fonts that look similar but are technically different
- Use fonts with clear visual differences

### The Rule of Thumb
Choose **2-3 fonts with clear visual differences and complementary personalities**. When in doubt, use weight variations of a single font—it's always safe, always looks professional.

## 11. Typographic Color & Texture

Text creates a visual "color" or "tone" on the page.

### Typographic Color
The overall grey-tone a block of text creates. Two paragraphs in the same font can look like completely different densities based on:
- Line spacing (tight = darker, loose = lighter)
- Word spacing (tight = darker, loose = lighter)
- Font weight (bold = darker, light = lighter)
- Column width (narrow = different texture than wide)

**In Practice:**
A densely-spaced paragraph looks heavy and serious. The same text with loose leading looks airy and refined.

### Creating Texture
Intentionally vary the texture to create visual interest:

**Tight Leading + Small Font = Dense**
Serious, formal, weighty texture. Good for contracts, legal documents.

**Loose Leading + Generous Margins = Airy**
Refined, premium, contemporary texture. Good for luxury, editorial, poetry.

**Varying Sizes = Chaotic**
Energetic, playful, dynamic texture. Good for posters, experimental designs.

**Single Column = Different from Multiple Columns**
Narrow columns create different rhythm than wide columns, even with same font.

### Thinking About Text Visually
Don't just read the words. Step back and look at the paragraph as a shape:
- Is it visually interesting?
- Does density match the content (serious = dense, playful = loose)?
- Does the overall texture convey the right mood?

## 12. Typography Across Formats

Typography requirements differ wildly by medium.

### Print Typography

**Serif Fonts Preferred**
- Serifs guide the eye across the line
- Easier to read in long documents
- Georgia, Garamond, Cambria

**Size**
- Body text: 8-12pt (typical for books)
- Comfortable for sustained reading

**Leading**
- 120-150% of font size
- 12pt font = 14-18pt leading
- More breathing room than digital

**Line Length**
- 60-75 characters per line (ideal)
- Too wide = hard to track to next line
- Too narrow = choppy, hard to read

**Color**
- Black or very dark text on white/light background
- High contrast essential for print readability

### Digital / Web Typography

**Sans-Serif Fonts Preferred**
- Render better on screens (smooth diagonal lines)
- Arial, Helvetica, Open Sans, Montserrat

**Size**
- Body text: 14-16px minimum
- Smaller than print (screens are closer to eyes)
- Mobile needs even larger (16px+)

**Leading**
- 1.5-1.8 line-height
- More generous than print
- Compensates for screen fatigue

**Line Length**
- 40-50 characters per line
- Even shorter on mobile
- Long lines cause eye strain on screens

**Color**
- Black or very dark on white works
- But softer backgrounds (off-white) can reduce eye strain
- Still need high contrast for readability

### Mobile Typography

**Extra Considerations**
- Font must be large enough (16px+ minimum)
- Line length must be short (25-30 characters)
- Leading must be generous (1.6-1.8)
- Tap targets for interactive text must be large enough (44px+ height)
- Test on actual devices, not just desktop zoom

## 13. How to Choose the Right Font

A decision framework.

### Ask These Questions

**1. What is the purpose?**
- Official document? → Serif, formal
- Website? → Sans-serif, contemporary
- Poster? → Display font, personality
- Invitation? → Script or elegant serif
- Code documentation? → Monospace

**2. What is the mood?**
- Formal, trustworthy? → Serif (Georgia, Garamond)
- Modern, friendly? → Sans-serif (Open Sans, Montserrat)
- Bold, attention-grabbing? → Display (Bebas Neue, Impact)
- Elegant, luxury? → Script or high-fashion serif (Bodoni, Playfair Display)
- Technical, code-like? → Monospace (Fira Code)

**3. Who is the audience?**
- Business professionals? → Conservative serif or neutral sans
- Young people? → Contemporary sans or playful font
- Luxury market? → Elegant serif or refined display
- Accessibility needs? → Large x-height, open counters, high contrast

**4. How long is the text?**
- Headline only? → Any font works (display fonts fine)
- Paragraph? → Body-text-friendly serif or sans
- Long document? → Serif preferred (easier on eyes)
- Fine print? → High x-height, open design

**5. Where will it appear?**
- Print? → Serif often better
- Screen? → Sans-serif often better
- Both? → Serif for print, sans for web (or choose font that works in both contexts)

### Vetting Process

Before committing to a font:

**Test at Multiple Sizes**
- Headline size (it might look great at 48pt but bad at 12pt)
- Body size
- Small sizes (fine print)
- Does it work across sizes?

**Check Character Set**
- Does it have accents? (é, ñ, ç)
- Does it have symbols? (©, ®, €)
- Does it have all currencies you need?
- Can you use it for international text?

**Ensure Multiple Weights Available**
- Do you have Light? Regular? Bold?
- Plan your hierarchy: can you achieve it with this font family?

**Test in Context**
- Don't judge a font in isolation
- Put it in your actual design
- Does it work with your color scheme, imagery, layout?

**Check Tricky Pairs**
- lowercase "l" vs. uppercase "I" - are they different?
- "O" (letter) vs. "0" (zero) - are they different?
- "1" (one) vs. "l" (lowercase L) vs. "I" (uppercase I) - all distinct?
- "rn" together - does "rn" look like "m"?

---

## 14. Typography as Visual Art

When text becomes the design itself.

### Creative Approaches

**Text as Shape**
- Arrange letters to form an image
- Make letters spell one thing but their arrangement suggest another
- Example: "FOREST" spelled with green letters arranged in a tree shape

**Distortion**
- Stretch letters (wider, narrower)
- Rotate letters
- Warp or curve text along a path
- Still must remain legible (rule: artistic typography ≠ unreadable)

**Layering**
- Overlap transparent text layers
- Different colors create depth
- Different opacities create depth

**Scale Play**
- Extreme size variations within one word
- First letter huge, rest tiny
- Creates visual drama and guides reading order

**Color Override**
- Highlight specific letters in contrasting color
- Emphasize certain words
- Create visual patterns with color within text

### When to Use Artistic Typography

**Good Uses:**
- Posters where craft matters
- Headlines demanding attention
- Artistic statements
- Branding (logos, special applications)
- Where the designer is credited (design is expected to be craft-focused)

**Poor Uses:**
- Body copy (readers want comfort, not art)
- Accessibility-critical content
- Where clarity is essential
- When the audience expects straightforward design

### The Rule
Artistic typography should still be legible, even if unconventional. The reader might have to work slightly harder to parse it, but they should still be able to.

## 15. Common Mistakes & Pro Habits

### Common Mistakes Amateurs Make

1. **Too Many Fonts**
   - Limit to 2-3 maximum
   - Mix = chaos

2. **Text Too Small**
   - People can't read it comfortably
   - Print minimum: 8pt for body
   - Web minimum: 14px for body

3. **Poor Contrast**
   - Light grey on white = illegible
   - Aim for 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum
   - Use WebAIM contrast checker

4. **Bad Kerning**
   - Software defaults are rarely perfect
   - Manual adjustment required for headlines
   - Especially important for all-caps text

5. **Ignoring Line Length**
   - Lines too wide = hard to track to next line
   - Lines too narrow = choppy reading
   - Sweet spot: 50-75 characters

6. **All Caps for Body Text**
   - Takes 35% longer to read
   - Harder for dyslexic readers
   - Reserve for headlines and short emphasis

7. **Ignoring Leading**
   - Too tight = cramped
   - Default leading often insufficient
   - Increase for better readability

### Pro Habits to Develop

1. **Test Type at Actual Size**
   - Don't design at 100% zoom on your 27" monitor
   - Print it
   - View it from across the room
   - Check on mobile devices

2. **Adjust Kerning Manually for Headlines**
   - Don't trust automatic kerning
   - Spend 5 minutes fixing problem pairs
   - The difference between amateur and polished

3. **Use Appropriate Leading (Not Default)**
   - Calculate intentionally (1.5-1.8 for web, 1.2-1.5 for print)
   - Adjust for your specific font

4. **Choose Serif for Long Documents**
   - Serifs guide the eye
   - Easier on eyes for sustained reading

5. **Check Contrast Ratio**
   - Use WebAIM Color Contrast Checker
   - Aim for 4.5:1 (AA standard)
   - 7:1 for better accessibility (AAA)

6. **Maintain Multiple Font Weights**
   - Download Light, Regular, Bold
   - Saves space vs. using multiple fonts
   - Creates cohesion

7. **Test for Accessibility**
   - Can people with low vision read it?
   - Can people with color blindness distinguish it?
   - Is it keyboard navigable?

## 16. Your Performance Tasks

### Task 1: Typeface Identification Quiz
**Objective:** Demonstrate your ability to recognize, classify, and understand typefaces.

**Assignment:**
Identify and classify 10 famous typefaces. For each:
- Identify the typeface name
- Classify it (Serif / Sans / Display / Script / Monospace)
- List 2-3 key anatomical features that help identify it
- Explain what makes this font suitable for its original purpose
- Suggest one contemporary brand or design that uses it

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Accuracy of identification
- Understanding of type anatomy
- Thoughtful analysis of purpose and psychology
- Quality of examples

### Task 2: Typographic Quote Poster
**Objective:** Make typography the primary visual element in a design.

**Assignment:**
Select an inspiring quote (2-4 sentences, significant enough to hold a poster).
Design a poster where **typography is the design**. Minimal or no imagery.

**Requirements:**
- Minimum 18"x24" (or equivalent digital dimensions)
- Font choice must support the quote's meaning (form = function)
- Hierarchy must be clear (reader knows what to read first)
- Sophisticated spacing (leading, tracking, kerning all intentional)
- Color supporting the design (not decorative, but purposeful)
- NO images required (typography is the art)

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Does font choice match quote meaning?
- Is hierarchy clear?
- Is spacing professional?
- Is it visually interesting without imagery?
- Can someone read and understand it from distance?

## 💡 Final Thought

"A beautiful page of typography is like a musical composition. Every element—from font size to letter spacing to white space—contributes to the overall harmony. Neglect any detail, and the whole falls apart. Master them all, and you create something that sings." — You, a typography master (soon)

Typography is patience. Typography is precision. Typography is love for the reader.

Master it, and you'll design with confidence that your message doesn't just look good—it *resonates*.

**You've got this.** ✍️
