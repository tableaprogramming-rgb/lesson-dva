## 🎯 Transcript Overview
Illustration is where technical precision meets artistic expression. This module focuses on using a graphics tablet to create professional digital drawings, ranging from realism to stylized character design.

### 1. Traditional Skills, Digital Tools
Digital illustration is still about the basics of drawing: anatomy, proportion, and lighting.

**Concepts Covered:**
- **The Stylus & Tablet:** Mastering brush pressure and tilt to create lines that feel "alive" rather than mechanical.
- **Line Economy:** Learning how to use fewer, more confident strokes to define forms.
- **Reference Usage:** How to use photos to study anatomy without directly tracing them.

### 2. Stylization (Manga & Comic Art)
Exaggeration for the sake of storytelling.

**Concepts Covered:**
- **Anatomy Distortion:** Understanding the "rules" of the human body so you can break them effectively for different styles.
- **Action Posing:** Using "lines of action" to give characters energy and movement.
- **Visual Personality:** How a character's clothing, hair, and facial features tell a story before they even speak.

### 3. Professional Rendering Techniques
Using the unique power of digital software (Photoshop/Affinity) to add depth.

**Concepts Covered:**
- **Non-Destructive Workflow:** Mastering layers, groups, and masks to keep your work editable.
- **Lighting Dynamics:** Using Rim Lighting, Ambient Occlusion, and Specular Highlights to make 2D drawings feel 3D.
- **Post-Processing:** Using adjustment layers (Curves, Color Balance) to give your illustration a cinematic finish.

### 4. Performance Tasks
1. **The Digital Self-portrait:** Capturing your own likeness while demonstrating mastery of skin textures and lighting.

### 💡 "You Can Do This" Sentiment
Digital illustration takes practice and patience. Don't be discouraged if your first few strokes feel awkward. The "undo" button is your best friend—use it to push your boundaries!

**Next Step:** Once you can draw the pilot, it's time to build the machine in **Module 9: Mecha Design**!
