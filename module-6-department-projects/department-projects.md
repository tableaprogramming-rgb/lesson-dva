# Module 6: Department Projects — Digital Visual Arts (DVA)

## 🎯 Transcript Overview
This module transitions from theoretical exercises to serving a real client: our own School of Computer Studies (SCS). We'll handle branding for products (T-shirts) and events (Posters).

### 1. Merchandise Design (SCS T-Shirt)
Designing for wearables requires a different mindset than designing for paper.

**Concepts Covered:**
- **Economic Design:** Learning to work within "spot color" limitations (e.g., a 2-color maximum) to reduce printing costs.
- **The Human Canvas:** Understanding how designs wrap around the body and where the primary focus should be (usually the chest or back).
- **Semantics of Technology:** Choosing symbols that represent computing without falling into clichés (e.g., using abstract nodes instead of just "0101").

### 2. Event Marketing (SCS Week Poster)
The objective here is high-energy communication.

**Concepts Covered:**
- **Information Architecture:** Ensuring the "When" and "Where" are as prominent as the "What".
- **Color Palettes for Urgency:** Using bright accents (like the primary gradient we've learned) to catch attention in a busy hallway.
- **Brand Consistency:** Ensuring the poster feels like it belongs to the SCS, using established department colors and logos.

### 3. Midterm Outcome: The SCS Digital Gallery
The midterm concludes with a collaborative effort.

**Concepts Covered:**
- **Curation:** Selecting only the strongest pieces of work to represent the class.
- **Peer Review:** Developing a professional vocabulary for critiquing and improving each other's work.
- **Digital Presentation:** Organizing files into a virtual exhibition space (e.g., a multi-page PDF or a specialized gallery website).

### 4. Performance Tasks
1. **Official T-Shirt Proposal:** A technical mockup of a shirt including color codes and placement instructions.

3. **Gallery Contribution:** Curating your Midterm work (Modules 3-6) for the class exhibition.

### 💡 "You Can Do This" Sentiment
Designing for your own community is the ultimate test of impact. When you see your T-shirt design being worn or your poster hanging on a wall, that's when you know you've transitioned from a student to a professional.

**Next Step:** Take these community skills and apply them to a unique brand identity in **Module 7: Branding & Logo Design**!
