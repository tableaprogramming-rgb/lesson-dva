## 🎯 Transcript Overview
Packaging design is the bridge between graphic design and industrial design. In this module, we learn how to think about visuals that wrap around three-dimensional objects.

### 1. Thinking in 2D for 3D (The Dieline)
The first step in packaging is understanding the "flat plan".

**Concepts Covered:**
- **The Dieline:** Mastering the technical drawing that serves as the blueprint for cutting and folding.
- **Bleeds and Safety:** Ensuring that colors extend far enough past the cut line to allow for small movements during printing.
- **Glue Tabs and Flaps:** Understanding the mechanics of how a physical box stays together.

### 2. The Multi-Sided Story
Unlike a poster, packaging is seen from many angles.

**Concepts Covered:**
- **The Primary Display Panel (PDP):** The "Face" of the product. This must grab attention instantly.
- **Side Panels:** Using these for storytelling, branding, or secondary information.
- **Bottom and Top Panels:** Often ignored, but vital for barcodes, safety warnings, and brand logos.

### 3. Material and Finish
The physical texture of a package changes how people feel about the product inside.

**Concepts Covered:**
- **Material Choice:** Matte vs. Glossy finishes and how they affect the vibrancy of colors.
- **Sustainability:** Thinking about eco-friendly packaging as a modern design requirement.
- **Digital Mockups:** Learning how to use Photoshop to "wrap" a 2D design onto a 3D model for client presentations.

### 4. Performance Tasks
1. **Commercial Redesign:** Taking a boring, real-world package (like a cereal box or toothpaste) and giving it a premium DVA makeover.
2. **The Prototype Build:** Printing your design, cutting it out, and physically assembling it to ensure the dlines work in the real world.
